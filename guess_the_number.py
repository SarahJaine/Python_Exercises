##Guess the Number from http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/
##The Goal: Similar to the first project, this project also uses the random module in Python.
##The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is.
##If the userâ€™s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low).
##If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear.
